# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  gamarch_players_hurts: "Every day millions of players practice their games and often get annoyed at losing too much or get stuck for too long on one level. This frustrates many people with latent potential. Sometimes they stop practicing that eSport because of stress or end up being discouraged by toxic players. Several go on a journey of learning all over the web searching for information in different places and thus obtaining diverse results. You glean information, tactics, and strategies and then put them into practice. And always repeat this process more and more improving your level in multiplayer. But sometimes you can not find good information or you waste a lot of time for it. Often you do not know the level of who posted it or you come across again with toxic players in various forums. And that's when Gamarch gets up."
